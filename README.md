# salvus
This is the front-end of my longtime Advanced Studies Project. When finished, it will contain one homepage, two form pages for students, a login page for administrators, and two management pages for admins.
Salvus overall is a program where students are able to fill out a form stating their student ID, status, and location which then updates a school or district-wide database. The forms are meant primarily to be filled out on mobile. This database also contains contact methods for parents so that parents are notified of their student's location after they update the form. On the admin side, administrators can create a new database, view updated information, and edit or remove information.
Feel free to use any part of this project.
